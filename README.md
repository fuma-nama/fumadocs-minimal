## Fumadocs Minimal

A minimal setup of Fumadocs core, powered by Shadcn UI.

### Headless

Fumadocs can be used as a headless library, the core is also documented under https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/headless.

Fumadocs aims to solve the problem of integrating Next.js with content (especially Markdown/MDX ecosystem).
For example, the built-in utility to generate sidebar items and document search.

With Shadcn UI, or your own favorite methods, you can also set up the UI quickly.

### Play

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
